Iventory
- Show individual scrap amount for deconstruction                       COMPLETE
- Add quick scrap button                                                COMPLETE
- The quick deconstruct button should either send you to the deconstruction workbench or only allow you to deconstruct one component at a time



Computer Stat Screen
- Think of a way to show when no component is selected. Either make all the stats zero and change title to say nothing socketed, or make it blank



Component Select Screen
- 
- 


Computers
- Component set bonuses
- Motherboard level requirements to socket components
- Buy new computers, must work with wifi bandwidth
    - Make the computer select screen


Workbench
- Errors to fix
- Update COmponent inventory when changeing workbench menu

TIER UPGRADE MENU

IDEA - a way to change how items are removed from the inventory
Change how items are taken from the inventory
Don't remove components from the inventory until you press the craft button
This could be useful in the future if we encounter any errors with the current system

 - Group components of same Tier/Level instead of adding a new line                 CAN DO IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE THINK OF A FASTER SOLUTION
 - Instead of destroying and instantiating list items, use object pooling           Stretch goal, just a performance increase to implement later



Research
- Remake the entire screen                                                                                      COMPLETE
